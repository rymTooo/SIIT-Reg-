# SIIT-Reg-
ITS229 Human Computer Interface Design group project
## Objective
  This project aim to create a prototype of a potentially improved registration website for our faculty (SIIT). The current(2023) registration website is old and haven't been revised for a long time. The interface is ambigious and non-intuative. We aim to build a prototype with an improved interface and add some features that we think will have a positive impact on usability, such as feedback, one-stop service page, and more.
